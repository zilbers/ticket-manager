This is super important, as this helps us be an ever-growing community, where we help one another achieve any goal that comes to mind, regardless of their coding level.\n\nHere's what we came up with:\n\n- Be nice. We love the atmosphere, and we love seeing how much everyone enjoys helping one another. We firmly believe that we should safeguard this culture—this is our space and we should protect it. We have different skills and  different challenges, so don't forget that each one of us was once a code baby :)\n- Do not repeat questions. Use the forum search. There's a great chance that someone has already solved the problem that you are facing. \n- Use meaningful titles. ‘How can I create a collapsing and expanding repeater?’ is a much better title than ‘Help please!’. This makes it easier for people to spot the posts that they can help with.\n- Use Hashtags. makes it #easy #to #follow #topics.\n- Multiple short posts are better than a long one. This allows other people to benefit from our posts after we're done with it. Keeping posts short makes it easy to find answers, and makes the post relevant for more people.\n- Keep questions focused and clear. This will make each question easier to solve, which makes it possible for more people to answer it.\n- Format the text in your question. Use Code blocks, bullets, etc. to make it easier to understand.\n- Refrain from posting a long code. Debugging code is difficult enough when it's a short one. Post only relevant part of code.\n- Provide as many details as possible. Share what you think is right, what you’ve tried to do, and what blocks you. Include any relevant screenshots, code, and URLs to make it easier for others to understand the problem.\n- Acknowledge our peers’ help by marking a 'Top Comment' for the best answer. This will also make it easier to spot the correct answer.\n\n\nLast but not least: WORK HARD, PLAY HARDER!. Have fun in the process ;)\n\n","userEmail":"kekikum@segtaj.gh","creationTime":1545880457898,"labels":["Corvid","Guidelines"]},{"id":"ab6fc754-0e01-5cfb-84b9-cf37c1c0cdb5","title":"Collapse/expand code affecting the page footer\n","content":"I have placed collapse/expand code onto one of my pages, but the footer now has a huge white space above it in the preview.
